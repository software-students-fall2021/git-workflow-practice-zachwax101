<h5>Hey everyone, here is an interesting article about IoT (internent of things) 
and which languages developers most favor with regards to it. I find this interesting because many of 
the devices (the things) are things we interact with, or will increasingly interact with on an 
everyday basis. Aside from just regular reasons to prefer one language or tool over another, the article
discusses a multi-language future for IoT.

#### Pengfan's Comment:
IoT is a popular topic right now. Many big tech companies such as google, amazon, apple are developing smart home hubs that can help customers control the home devices "smartly." It is interesting to know what programming languages are popular for developing IoT.
